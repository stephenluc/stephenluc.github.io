				<h3>Hey, here is a bit about myself</h3>
				<p>I'm currently in my third year at the <a href="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/home/" target"_blank">University of Toronto Scaraborough Campus</a>, pursuing a major in Computer Science with a specialization in Software Engineering.</p>
				<p>I've interned at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/stephen.n.luc" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://zanbato.com/" target="_blank">Zanbato</a> and <a href="http://www.brainvision.ca/" target="_blank">BrainVision</a>. I have experience in Software Engineering, Data Engineering, Full-Stack Web Development and Andriod Mobile Development</p>
				<p>I'm always down to play any sport like frisbee, ice hockey, volleyball and basketball or go hike Yosemite. However, if you aren't the active type, I also enjoy sitting down grabbing a nice cold beer and playing some board games, as well!</p>
