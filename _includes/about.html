<p>I'm in my fourth year of studies at the University of Toronto, pursuing a major in Computer Science with a specialization in Software Engineering.</p>
<p>I've interned at <a class='main-text' href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/facebook/about/?ref=page_internal" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a class='main-text' href="https://zanbato.com/" target="_blank">Zanbato</a> and <a class='main-text' href="http://www.brainvision.ca/" target="_blank">BrainVision</a>. I have experience in Software Engineering, Data Engineering, Full-Stack Web Development, and Andriod Mobile Development</p>
<p>I'm always down to play any sport like ultimate frisbee, ice hockey, bouldering, and volleyball or go hike Yosemite. However, if that isn't your cup of tea, I also love playing board games, as well!</p>
