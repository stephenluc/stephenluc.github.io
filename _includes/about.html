<p>I've worked full time at WhatsApp on Calling Infra and was previously at Oculus on OS Services. I worked on building and scaling microservices for both products to allow for new features to be built on each of the respective products.</p>
<p>I've interned at <a class='main-text unselected' href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/facebook/about/?ref=page_internal" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a class='main-text unselected' href="https://zanbato.com/" target="_blank">Zanbato</a> and <a class='main-text unselected' href="http://www.brainvision.ca/" target="_blank">BrainVision</a>. The experience gained during these internships were full-stack web dev, data engineering and android development.</p>
<p>I graduated from the University of Toronto with a HBSc. Specializing in Software Engineering.</p>
<p>I'd like to say I'm a pretty active person and I'm always down to play any kind of sport like ultimate frisbee, ice hockey, bouldering, or go hiking somewhere. However, if you aren't a fan of the outdoors, I love playing board games, as well!</p>
