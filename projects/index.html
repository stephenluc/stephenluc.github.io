	<span>CheaprEats makes the cross-interaction between the customer and vendor a lot easier while being targeted to post-secondary students. CheaprEats will allow you to process, order, monitor and process payment for daily deals, menu items, and specials while heavily discounting late night and leftover meals directly off your phone while earning loyalty points per delivery.</span>

	<span>OneSearch is an addicting twist of the classic word search game. In this game, only the letters of the word are used as a part of the grid and the word appears only once in the grid. You have one minute to find as many words as you can.</span>
